        <p>
       India is the rabies capital of the world with more than 70% of the world cases coming from here. The idea behind the project is to raise funds for the Dogs to help them with hospitality, food, and shelter and vasectomy. To cope with with the rising population of the stray dogs and stop the killing of these dogs with cruelty and to rectify the mistakes and move ahead towards the future and controlling the spread of the disease.

         Pawsitive is a platform where people can buy Nfts through which we raise funds for dogs.Now all the nft holders will be given a special voting right and they will be made into a DAO member where they can decide on which proposal to vote for how all the money collected by nft will be used towards finding the solution to this problem.
